"Come, Lord Jesus!" was the cry for many in 2020. With so much pain and suffering, most of us were glad to see the year end. The first entry in today's _Morning and Evening_ devotional touched on the same theme, but with a more positive and hopeful outlook.

What a great reminder that we are destined for the eternal Promised Land, and that we can long for that day without fear. Of course, we don't have to wait to enjoy the benefits of communion with the Lord:

> During this year, we will gather a heavenly harvest on earthly ground, where faith and hope turn a desert into the garden of the Lord.
