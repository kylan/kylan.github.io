title: No Mercy for Detroit Mercy
---

We watched the WSU men's basketball team played Detroit Mercy yesterday. They won with a final score of 96-54.

At what point does the (Detroit) Mercy Rule come into play? I was thinking the threshold was a sixty point lead, but we didn't quite get there. It's crazy to say, but the game was nowhere near as close as the final score reflects...

Man, how would it feel to play for the team that invented the automatic forfeit?
