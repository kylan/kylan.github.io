Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for physical access management of an access-controlled area of a distributed site of an electric power delivery system using one or more one or more articulated access control policies. In some embodiments, to authenticate rights to access an access-controlled area, a first user may provide an associated access control system with credentials satisfying first authentication requirements based on an applicable policy. In connection with subsequent access authentication requests, the access control system may accept credentials satisfying second authentication requirements that may be different than the first authentication requirements. In this manner, access control requirements to the access-controlled area may be managed based on an associated articulated policy.

# [US9779566B2 Resource management based on physical authentication and authorization](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/26/f7/77/444d1e3b4f39cf/US9779566.pdf)

Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for management of resources of one or more systems included in an access-controlled area of a distributed site of an electric power delivery system. In certain embodiments, one or more users entering and access-controlled area may be identified via physical access control credentials provided to an associated access control system. A determination may be made as to whether the users have access rights to one or more hardware and/or software resources of systems included in the access-controlled area. Based on the determination, control signals may be generated by the access control system to enable and/or disable associated resources.

# [US9773363B2 Transient asset management systems and methods](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/70/11/e7/e51063faeec153/US9773363.pdf)

Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for managing transient assets used in connection with an access-controlled area of a distribution site of an electric power delivery system. In some embodiments, one or more users entering and access-controlled area may be identified via physical access control credentials provided to an associated access control system. Transient assets brought within an access-controlled area may be detected via one or more wired and/or wireless communication channels and may be associated with the one or more identified users located within the access-controlled area.
