# [US11418432B1 Automated communication flow discovery and configuration in a software defined network] (https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/6e/a3/33/af95763211b4c1/US11418432.pdf)

![](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/a4/04/e5/20154f08abdac1/US11418432-20220816-D00000.png)

The present disclosure pertains to systems and methods for automating the configuration of a software defined network (‚ÄúSDN‚Äù). In one embodiment, a system may include a first communication host and a second communication host configured to transmit information to the first communication host. A network may provide communication between the first communication host and the second communication host using a plurality of network devices. An SDN controller in communication with the network may include an approved service subsystem to match the communication with an approved service. The SDN controller may also include an analysis subsystem configured to identify a communication flow corresponding to information transmitted by the second communication host to the first communication host. A traffic routing subsystem of the SDN controller may create the communication flow identified by the analysis subsystem between the second communication host and the first communication host.

# [US11323362B2 Resilience to single event upsets in software defined networks] (https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/90/db/79/8727002f15dc7f/US11323362.pdf)

![](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/b6/93/1e/e1f681d4aefc39/US11323362-20220503-D00000.png)

The present disclosure pertains to improving resilience to single event upsets (‚ÄúSEUs‚Äù) in a software-defined network (‚ÄúSDN‚Äù). In one embodiment, a system may include a communications interface to receive and transmit a data packet. A primary data flow repository may store a plurality of communication flows to be used to route the data packet. A secondary data flow repository may store a subset of communication flows to be used to route a data packet. A system may search the plurality of communication flows in the primary data flow repository based on a criteria associated with the data packet. If no communication flow satisfies the criteria, a secondary data flow repository may be searched. The data packet may be routed according to a communication flow in the secondary data flow repository. The communication flow from the secondary data flow repository may be duplicated in the primary data flow repository.

# [US10404714B1 Policy-managed physical access authentication](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/34/70/65/1da08fb45c121a/US10404714.pdf)

Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for physical access management of an access-controlled area of a distributed site of an electric power delivery system using one or more one or more articulated access control policies. In some embodiments, to authenticate rights to access an access-controlled area, a first user may provide an associated access control system with credentials satisfying first authentication requirements based on an applicable policy. In connection with subsequent access authentication requests, the access control system may accept credentials satisfying second authentication requirements that may be different than the first authentication requirements. In this manner, access control requirements to the access-controlled area may be managed based on an associated articulated policy.

# [US10380815B2 Transient asset management systems and methods](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/42/a2/ef/0c54e4b57786b5/US10380815.pdf)

![](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/0c/b6/60/e36b8107e49fda/US10380815-20190813-D00000.png)

Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for managing transient assets used in connection with an access-controlled area of a distribution site of an electric power delivery system. In some embodiments, one or more users entering and access-controlled area may be identified via physical access control credentials provided to an associated access control system. Transient assets brought within an access-controlled area may be detected via one or more wired and/or wireless communication channels and may be associated with the one or more identified users located within the access-controlled area.

# [US9779566B2 Resource management based on physical authentication and authorization](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/26/f7/77/444d1e3b4f39cf/US9779566.pdf)

![](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/f0/60/53/fb8a36a887bd1a/US09779566-20171003-D00000.png)

Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for management of resources of one or more systems included in an access-controlled area of a distributed site of an electric power delivery system. In certain embodiments, one or more users entering and access-controlled area may be identified via physical access control credentials provided to an associated access control system. A determination may be made as to whether the users have access rights to one or more hardware and/or software resources of systems included in the access-controlled area. Based on the determination, control signals may be generated by the access control system to enable and/or disable associated resources.
