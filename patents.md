Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for managing transient assets used in connection with an access-controlled area of a distribution site of an electric power delivery system. In some embodiments, one or more users entering and access-controlled area may be identified via physical access control credentials provided to an associated access control system. Transient assets brought within an access-controlled area may be detected via one or more wired and/or wireless communication channels and may be associated with the one or more identified users located within the access-controlled area.

Systems and methods are disclosed that provide for management of resources of one or more systems included in an access-controlled area of a distributed site of an electric power delivery system. In certain embodiments, one or more users entering and access-controlled area may be identified via physical access control credentials provided to an associated access control system. A determination may be made as to whether the users have access rights to one or more hardware and/or software resources of systems included in the access-controlled area. Based on the determination, control signals may be generated by the access control system to enable and/or disable associated resources.
